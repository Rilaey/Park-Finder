# Park Finder

## Feeling adventurous? Let our Park Finder choose your next destination for you! With this randomly generated park finder search by state and which activities best suit you!

- The motivation behind building the Park Finder was to give the user a new destination to explore. Possibly a park they might have never known existed.

- Park Finder takes the thinking out of finding a new destination for the user to explore. When a park is randomly generated for the user, they are greeted with basic information about the park along with a link to The National Park Service website with more information regarding the park and amenities.

- During the duration of this project we learned the ins and outs of the National Park API along with the Google Maps API. The power of combining the two together allowed us to achieve the finished product of the Parks Finder tool. Along with learning both APIs we grew our skill set on local storage items while allowing the user to save their favorite parks to a new tab on the page.
